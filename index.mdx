## Developing Freedeck Packages

Packages are an umbrella term for anything that is installed by the user. Their type is defined by what they actually do.

<Tip>
  When making a package, it should feel as close to being part of Freedeck natively as possible. Try not to steer away from Freedeck's built in styling/theming methods.
