## Get started in three steps

Get your Freedeck ready to use.

### Step 1: Getting the App

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Get Node and Git" icon="folders">
    Freedeck runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). You need to download them before using Freedeck.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Download the App" icon="copy">
    To actually use Freedeck, you need the App. [You can download the latest version by clicking here.](https://github.com/Freedeck/app/releases/latest/download/Freedeck.exe)

    To clarify, the "App" is the native Windows app that allows for system control and auto updates. The "Server" is the underlying data processor that handles the tile database. The "Client" is your phone, just a viewer of the tiles. The "Companion" is the desktop application that opens on your computer that lets you edit the configuration.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Run the App" icon="rectangle-terminal">
    Run the app\! Double click it from your downloads folder or wherever it is.

    <Warning>
      Windows may give you a SmartScreen popup. _This is because Freedeck is not signed, as that costs money._
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
